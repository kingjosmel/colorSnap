# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ColorSnap is a Next.js web application that extracts color palettes from uploaded images and provides corresponding Tailwind CSS class names. The app uses color analysis libraries to generate clean, developer-friendly color palettes.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build production version
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Main App (`src/app/page.js`)** - Single-page application with drag-and-drop image upload, color extraction using ColorThief, and color matching against Tailwind palette
- **ColorSwatch (`src/components/ColorSwatch.js`)** - Individual color display component with copy-to-clipboard functionality for hex codes and Tailwind classes
- **Layout (`src/app/layout.js`)** - Root layout with Vercel Analytics integration

### Color Processing Pipeline

1. **Image Upload** - Handles drag-and-drop with react-dropzone, validates image types and file size (5MB limit)
2. **Color Extraction** - Uses ColorThief library to extract 5 dominant colors from uploaded image
3. **Tailwind Matching** - Compares extracted colors against predefined Tailwind color palette using chroma-js color distance calculations in LAB color space
4. **Display** - Shows color swatches with hex values and closest matching Tailwind class names

### Key Libraries

- **ColorThief** (`color-thief-browser`) - Extracts dominant colors from images
- **chroma-js** - Color manipulation and distance calculations for Tailwind matching
- **react-dropzone** - File upload handling with drag-and-drop support
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Styling framework

### Data Structure

Colors are processed as objects with:
```javascript
{
  hex: "#ffffff", // Extracted color
  tailwindClass: "slate-50" // Closest matching Tailwind class
}
```

### Utility Functions

- `rgbToHex()` - Converts RGB values to hex format
- `matchTailwindColor()` - Finds closest Tailwind color using LAB color space distance
- Complete Tailwind color palette mapping in `src/lib/tailwindColors.js`
